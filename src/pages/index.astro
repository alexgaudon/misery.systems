        misery.systems is the affectionate name for my homelab.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a collection of projects and tools that I've built or am working on.

      <h1>Why misery.systems?</h1>
      <p>
        misery.systems was chosen when I decided to add a Kubernetes cluster to my homelab.
      </p>
      <p>
        For people with experience in Kubernetes, that might make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it's a reference to the fact that Kubernetes is a complex system that is often a source of misery.
