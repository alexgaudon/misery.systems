  <div class="space-y-3 text-lg" style="color: var(--cat-text);">
    <p>
      <strong style="color: var(--cat-peach);">misery.systems</strong> is what I
      (affectionately) call my homelab.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s a small virtualized Kubernetes cluster. Specifically Talos running on three
      Proxmox nodes. I use it for learning, testing, and hosting a few personal
      projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      I wanted a name that was short and kind of funny, and I was out of better
      ideas. There’s a long-running joke that Kubernetes can be a source of
      misery for its users.
    </p>

    <p>
      The individual nodes (as seen on the
      <Link href="/about" brackets={false}>about page</Link>) came from asking ChatGPT for
      “misery-themed homelab hostnames” and picking the first three that were
      short, single words.
    </p>

    <p>If you’ve spent time with Kubernetes, that might be relatable.</p>
